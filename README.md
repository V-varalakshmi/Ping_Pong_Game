# Ping_Pong_Game
Description:

This is a simple two-player Ping Pong game developed using Python's turtle graphics module. The game features two paddles and a ball that moves across the screen. Players control the paddles using keyboard keys (W/S for Player A and Up/Down for Player B). Points are scored when the opponent misses the ball, and the score is displayed at the top. The game continues until one player reaches the winning score (default is 5). It includes collision detection, paddle boundaries, and a real-time score update system. This project demonstrates basic game logic, event handling, and graphical programming in Python.
